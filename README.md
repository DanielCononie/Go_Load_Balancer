# Go_Load_Balancer
A custom Go-based load balancer that distributes incoming HTTP requests across multiple servers using a round-robin/least connections algorithm. It features performance monitoring such as active connections and requests per server. The project also integrates proxy forwarding, and metrics for tracking server health and request distribution.
